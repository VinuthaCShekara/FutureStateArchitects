# ADR-007: Use Azure SQL Database for Ticketing and Payment Transaction State

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision owners:** Architecture, business capability owner, security, operations, and data/AI owners as applicable
- **Date:** To be assigned on approval
- **Related HLD:** Von Digitalis Estates digital platform
- **Supersedes:** None
- **Superseded by:** None

## Context

Orders, tickets, family passes, entitlements, and payment outcomes require transactional integrity, constraints, auditability, and strongly consistent state transitions.

The design must support growth from approximately 5,000 to at least 15,000 visitors per day, 40 rides, more than 200 animals across 55 displays and enclosures, intermittent estate connectivity, and business-critical ticketing and animal-care workflows. Final regions, SKUs, numeric SLOs, and cost commitments remain subject to non-functional requirements, load testing, compliance review, and cost analysis.

## Decision Drivers

- Business continuity and visitor safety
- Animal-welfare safeguards
- Scalability and operational supportability
- Security, privacy, and auditability
- Loose coupling and replaceability
- Measurable reliability, performance, and cost
- Avoidance of unvalidated product, capacity, and cost commitments

## Decision

Use Azure SQL Database as the system of record for ticket, order, family-pass, entitlement, and payment transaction state. Keep payment card data outside the platform unless explicitly required and approved. Store provider references and required audit metadata. Use optimistic concurrency and idempotent transaction handling.

## Alternatives Considered

- Use Cosmos DB as the primary transaction store
- Use the analytical lake as the transaction store
- Store transaction state only in events

## Consequences

- Relational integrity and transactional operations are supported.
- Schema evolution and scaling require disciplined engineering.
- Availability, backup, geo-recovery, RPO, and RTO configurations remain subject to business NFRs.

### Positive

- Establishes an explicit design standard that downstream solution designs can validate against.
- Supports consistent security, observability, resilience, and governance controls.

### Negative or Trade-offs

- Introduces implementation and operational work that must be reflected in delivery plans.
- Requires evidence from NFR definition, performance testing, security review, and cost analysis before production approval.

## Security and Privacy Implications

- Apply least privilege, encryption in transit and at rest, managed identities where supported, and Key Vault for secrets and certificates.
- Minimize personal and sensitive data in payloads, logs, traces, prompts, and analytical stores.
- Record privileged and material business actions in tamper-resistant audit records.
- Perform threat modelling and privacy review before production release.

## Reliability and Failure Handling

- Use bounded retries, timeout budgets, circuit breakers, bulkheads, idempotency, and dead-letter handling where relevant.
- Define deterministic degradation behavior for dependency, connectivity, and AI failures.
- Validate backup, restore, replay, and reconciliation procedures.

## Observability

- Emit structured logs, platform and application metrics, distributed traces, business KPIs, and audit events.
- Propagate correlation and trace identifiers across API, messaging, streaming, edge, and AI flows.
- Define service ownership, alert severity, runbook, and escalation path for each actionable condition.

## Cost Implications

No numeric estimate is approved by this ADR. Cost drivers include service tier and capacity, transaction and event volume, data retention, network transfer, edge hardware, observability ingestion, AI inference, and recovery topology. Validate the decision using agreed workload assumptions and the Azure pricing process before approval.

## Risks and Mitigations

Data loss, duplicate issuance, and inconsistent payment state are mitigated through backups, point-in-time restore, idempotency, transaction isolation, audit records, and reconciliation.

## Implementation and Validation Actions

- [ ] Define the canonical transaction state model.
- [ ] Implement encryption, auditing, retention, masking, and least-privilege access.
- [ ] Define backup, restore, failover, and reconciliation tests.
- [ ] Load-test peak purchase scenarios and retry storms.

## Compliance Evidence Required

- Approved architecture and threat model
- NFR and workload assumptions
- Performance and resilience test results
- Security and privacy review
- Operational runbooks and ownership matrix
- Cost model and budget-alert design

## Review Triggers

Review this ADR when business volumes, regulation, connectivity, safety requirements, Azure service capabilities, regional strategy, data classification, or measured production behavior materially changes.
