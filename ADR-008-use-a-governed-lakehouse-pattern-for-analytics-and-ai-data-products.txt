# ADR-008: Use a Governed Lakehouse Pattern for Analytics and AI Data Products

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision owners:** Architecture, business capability owner, security, operations, and data/AI owners as applicable
- **Date:** To be assigned on approval
- **Related HLD:** Von Digitalis Estates digital platform
- **Supersedes:** None
- **Superseded by:** None

## Context

Visitor popularity, operational reporting, historical animal observations, model training, and AI evaluation need traceable raw data and trusted business-ready datasets.

The design must support growth from approximately 5,000 to at least 15,000 visitors per day, 40 rides, more than 200 animals across 55 displays and enclosures, intermittent estate connectivity, and business-critical ticketing and animal-care workflows. Final regions, SKUs, numeric SLOs, and cost commitments remain subject to non-functional requirements, load testing, compliance review, and cost analysis.

## Decision Drivers

- Business continuity and visitor safety
- Animal-welfare safeguards
- Scalability and operational supportability
- Security, privacy, and auditability
- Loose coupling and replaceability
- Measurable reliability, performance, and cost
- Avoidance of unvalidated product, capacity, and cost commitments

## Decision

Use Azure Data Lake Storage with logically separated raw, validated, and curated zones. Publish governed data products for reporting and approved AI use cases. Apply schema validation, data-quality rules, lineage, classification, retention, access controls, and reproducible transformations. Select the processing and analytics engine during detailed design based on workload evidence.

## Alternatives Considered

- Use operational databases directly for enterprise analytics
- Store only curated data and discard raw observations
- Select a full analytics engine before workload validation

## Consequences

- Historical traceability and reuse improve.
- Storage and processing costs depend on event volume, retention, file layout, and query patterns.
- Data governance and product ownership are required.

### Positive

- Establishes an explicit design standard that downstream solution designs can validate against.
- Supports consistent security, observability, resilience, and governance controls.

### Negative or Trade-offs

- Introduces implementation and operational work that must be reflected in delivery plans.
- Requires evidence from NFR definition, performance testing, security review, and cost analysis before production approval.

## Security and Privacy Implications

- Apply least privilege, encryption in transit and at rest, managed identities where supported, and Key Vault for secrets and certificates.
- Minimize personal and sensitive data in payloads, logs, traces, prompts, and analytical stores.
- Record privileged and material business actions in tamper-resistant audit records.
- Perform threat modelling and privacy review before production release.

## Reliability and Failure Handling

- Use bounded retries, timeout budgets, circuit breakers, bulkheads, idempotency, and dead-letter handling where relevant.
- Define deterministic degradation behavior for dependency, connectivity, and AI failures.
- Validate backup, restore, replay, and reconciliation procedures.

## Observability

- Emit structured logs, platform and application metrics, distributed traces, business KPIs, and audit events.
- Propagate correlation and trace identifiers across API, messaging, streaming, edge, and AI flows.
- Define service ownership, alert severity, runbook, and escalation path for each actionable condition.

## Cost Implications

No numeric estimate is approved by this ADR. Cost drivers include service tier and capacity, transaction and event volume, data retention, network transfer, edge hardware, observability ingestion, AI inference, and recovery topology. Validate the decision using agreed workload assumptions and the Azure pricing process before approval.

## Risks and Mitigations

Uncontrolled collection could create privacy and cost risks. Apply minimization, consent boundaries, retention enforcement, access reviews, and lifecycle policies.

## Implementation and Validation Actions

- [ ] Define domains, data owners, classifications, and retention schedules.
- [ ] Define partitioning, compaction, late-arrival, correction, and deletion approaches.
- [ ] Select catalog, lineage, processing, and BI services through follow-on ADRs.
- [ ] Create data-quality SLOs and validation dashboards.

## Compliance Evidence Required

- Approved architecture and threat model
- NFR and workload assumptions
- Performance and resilience test results
- Security and privacy review
- Operational runbooks and ownership matrix
- Cost model and budget-alert design

## Review Triggers

Review this ADR when business volumes, regulation, connectivity, safety requirements, Azure service capabilities, regional strategy, data classification, or measured production behavior materially changes.
